## Comparison Notes (Research: Jan 2025)

### vs Homunculus

Homunculus v2 takes a more sophisticated approach:

| Feature | Our Approach | Homunculus v2 |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Observation | Stop hook (end of session) | PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks (100% reliable) |
| Analysis | Main context | Background agent (Haiku) |
| Granularity | Full skills | Atomic "instincts" |
| Confidence | None | 0.3-0.9 weighted |
| Evolution | Direct to skill | Instincts â†’ cluster â†’ skill/command/agent |
| Sharing | None | Export/import instincts |

**Key insight from homunculus:**
> "v1 relied on skills to observe. Skills are probabilisticâ€”they fire ~50-80% of the time. v2 uses hooks for observation (100% reliable) and instincts as the atomic unit of learned behavior."

### Potential v2 Enhancements

1. **Instinct-based learning** - Smaller, atomic behaviors with confidence scoring
2. **Background observer** - Haiku agent analyzing in parallel
3. **Confidence decay** - Instincts lose confidence if contradicted
4. **Domain tagging** - code-style, testing, git, debugging, etc.
5. **Evolution path** - Cluster related instincts into skills/commands
