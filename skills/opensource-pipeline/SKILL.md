### /opensource verify PROJECT

Run sanitizer independently. Resolve path: if PROJECT contains `/`, treat as a path. Otherwise check `$HOME/opensource-staging/PROJECT`, then `$HOME/PROJECT`, then current directory.

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="opensource-sanitizer",
  prompt="Verify sanitization of: {resolved_path}. Run all 6 scan categories and generate SANITIZATION_REPORT.md."
)
```

---

### /opensource package PROJECT

Run packager independently. Ask for "License?" and "Description?", then:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="opensource-packager",
  prompt="Package: {resolved_path} ..."
)
```

---

### /opensource list

```bash
ls -d $HOME/opensource-staging/*/
```

Show each project with pipeline progress (FORK_REPORT.md, SANITIZATION_REPORT.md, CLAUDE.md presence).

---

### /opensource status PROJECT

```bash
cat $HOME/opensource-staging/${PROJECT}/SANITIZATION_REPORT.md
cat $HOME/opensource-staging/${PROJECT}/FORK_REPORT.md
```

## Staging Layout

```
$HOME/opensource-staging/
  my-project/
    FORK_REPORT.md           # From forker agent
    SANITIZATION_REPORT.md   # From sanitizer agent
    CLAUDE.md                # From packager agent
    setup.sh                 # From packager agent
    README.md                # From packager agent
    .env.example             # From forker agent
    ...                      # Sanitized project files
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Never** push to GitHub without user approval
- **Never** skip the sanitizer â€” it is the safety gate
- **Never** proceed after a sanitizer FAIL without fixing all critical findings
- **Never** leave `.env`, `*.pem`, or `credentials.json` in the staging directory

## Best Practices

- Always run the full pipeline (fork â†’ sanitize â†’ package) for new releases
- The staging directory persists until explicitly cleaned up â€” use it for review
- Re-run the sanitizer after any manual fixes before publishing
- Parameterize secrets rather than deleting them â€” preserve project functionality
